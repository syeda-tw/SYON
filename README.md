# SYON

**Say Yes or No**

A minimal decision-making app for developers who need clarity, not complexity.

## What is SYON?

SYON helps you pause, reflect, and make clear yes/no decisions. Built for developers who deal with constant choices—features to build, tools to try, opportunities to pursue—and need a simple way to cut through the noise.

No elaborate frameworks. No decision trees. Just: *Should I do this? Yes or No.*

## How it works

1. **Ask yourself a question** — "Should I build this feature?"
2. **Take a moment** — Let the question sit
3. **Decide** — Yes or No
4. **Move forward** — Track your decisions quietly in the background

SYON doesn't judge your choices. It just helps you make them clearly and move on.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **Tailwind CSS** for minimal, clean styling  
- **TypeScript** for reliability
- **Zustand** for lightweight state management

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start making decisions.

## Philosophy

Decision fatigue is real. SYON believes in:

- **Simplicity over features** — Binary choices are often the clearest
- **Reflection over reaction** — Take a beat before deciding
- **Progress over perfection** — Done is better than perfect
- **Flow over friction** — Get in, decide, get out
